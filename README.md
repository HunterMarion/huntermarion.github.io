## A Project by Hunter Marion & Michelle Phillips
### INEW 2320 - Comprehensive Software Design Project, Dallas College Spring 2023

For this project, we were tasked with designing our own project. We chose to design our project using [React](https://react.dev/). For styling, we chose to utilize [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). We used GitHub Projects to track our tasks for creating this project.

  ### Website Description
  
We designed a restaurant website where users can explore the menu, make reservations, see catering options, and add items to an online cart. On the checkout page they can see how much they owe and choose to add a tip. There includes an About Us page with both our "Restaurant" bios, as well as our school bios and school email addresses to contact us.
